# CECS428Lab4
One of the assignment for Advanced Algorithm course. The objective is to given a graph with vertices and weighted edges representing
the distance road intersection. Each intersection has to have a gas station but for every k distance from any vertices there has
to be a gas station. The problem is to find the minimum number of gas stations to put in vertices given the graph and k representing
the distance limit. The problem is NP-Complete.
